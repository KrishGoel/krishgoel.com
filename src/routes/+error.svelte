    <h1>You've reached a dead end.</h1>
	<p>Often referred to as /404 by Programmers (and emo-bois who feel internally-validated and think they sound very cool after captioning their sad sack of shit posts "Error 404: Feelings not found").</p>
	<p>Not a lot happens here, it's a really boring place and I wouldn't recommend coming here often.</p>
	<p>But because you're here, feel free to listen to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/39emqovi90p90iq1sfbczkan0?si=7eda258db2b04654" target="_blank" aria-label="My Spotify">some of my banging playlists</a>. <i>PS: My Spotify Playlists Section is basically a gallery.</i></p>
	<p>Or you may choose to head back <a href="/" aria-label="Home">/home</a>.</p>
	<p>Whatever choice you do make, best of luck on your journey.</p>
	<p>It may not end well, but it'll end and that's a certainty :)</p>
