title: Building an ANN from scratch
date: 01.01.2024
time: January 2025
description: I conducted a talk on building an Artificial Neural Net from scratch in Vanilla Python, this blogpost is essentially a transcript of the talk + notes. Goes into the depth of mathematics and gives a pretty good intuitive and technical understanding of how ANNs work.

I am still finding the time to put everything together, will update as I go. Here are the links to the slides and Python notebooks from the talk.

> [Figma Slides](https://www.figma.com/file/aWh41r8mGVr4TQTHQw2nXw/ANN-Talk?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=SJ5WR6p93Ww7Ryfq-1): These are not fully descriptive because a lot of whiteboard and marker was used, and donot cover the depth of the math - that was done on the board and code.

> [Python Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/KrishGoel/mnist-classifier): I've tried to write very neat code, will make more sense once I actually share my notes and workings here.

Best of luck
