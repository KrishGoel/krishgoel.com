abstract: "Objective: The objective of this study was to develop an open-source Clinical Trial Registry (CTR) Template which can help in development of registries, aligned to the WHO International Standards for Clinical Trial Registries. Implementation of the template will promotes transparency, integrity, and accessibility in clinical research.
Methods: The CTR template was developed using a Python-based web framework known as ‘Django’. It is fully customizable, independent of external dependencies, has a user-friendly UI, efficient data porting and containerized deployment. The codebase of CTR template is available on github (https://github. com/parhsingh/clinical-trial-registry-template).
Findings: The CTR template is a platform for developing/establishing national clinical trial registries in compliance to WHO International Standards for Clinical Trial Registries. The template is based on Django framework which has a large community support, hence is highly robust and customizable. Further the CTR template supports global interoperability and collaboration among trial registries by standardizing trial registration.
Conclusion: WHO has released International Standards for Clinical Trial Registries document to facilitate transparency and efficiency in trials. The developed template will assist the countries in implementing the WHO standards. However, there is need to address challenge of sustainability."
